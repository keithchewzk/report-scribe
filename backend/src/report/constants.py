CORE REPORT GUIDELINES:
1. **Tone & Audience:** Use a **formal**, professional, and educational tone suitable for parent communication. Avoid contractions (e.g., use "does not" instead of "doesn't").
2. **Voice:** Maintain a supportive and constructive voice, using **third-person language only** (avoid using "I," "We," "My," or "Our").
3. **Start:** Do not include any introductory phrases or prefixes (e.g., "Here is the report"). Start immediately with the report content.
4. **Conclusion:** **Do not offer any call-to-action or request for contact** (e.g., "please reach out," "contact me"). The report is summative.
5. **Quality:** Ensure the final text has proper grammar, spelling, and professional formatting.
